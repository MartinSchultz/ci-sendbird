# A Codeigniter library for Sendbird messaging and chat API
A quick and dirty Codeigniter library for using [Sendbird's](https://sendbird.com/) API.

# Install
Add the `config/sendbird.php` file into your `application/config` directory, optionally add that config to `config/autoload.php` so you do not need to do so manually.

Add the `library/Sendbird.php` file into your `application/libraries` directory.
